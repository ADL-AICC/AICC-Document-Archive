AICC Document Archive
=====================

The Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee (AICC) existed from 1988 to 2014.  

It created learning technology specifications used widely in the eLearning industry (inside and outside of aviation).  

Prior to its dissolution, the AICC transfered all its documents to the ADL for continued public access.

The following is an historical archive of AICC documents.
